# Setting Up Dynamic Review Environments in GitLab CI/CD

## Introduction

When developing new features or making changes to an application, it's incredibly valuable to have a way to preview and test changes before merging them into the main codebase.   
GitLab's dynamic review environments solve this problem by automatically creating temporary environments for each merge request, allowing developers, testers, and stakeholders to preview changes in a live environment.

## The Problem We're Solving

Currently, your pipeline might only deploy to staging and production environments. This means that to test new features, you need to:
1. Merge changes to the staging branch
2. Wait for deployment
3. Share the staging URL with stakeholders

This approach has several limitations:
- Only one feature can be tested at a time on staging
- Multiple developers can't test their changes simultaneously
- Changes must be merged before they can be properly reviewed

Review environments solve these problems by creating a unique environment for each merge request.

Currently, your pipeline might only deploy to staging and production environments. This means that to test new features, you need to:

3. Share the staging URL with stakeholders

This approach has several limitations:

- Multiple developers can't test their changes simultaneously
- Changes must be merged before they can be properly reviewed

Review environments solve these problems by creating a unique environment for each merge request.

## Adding Review Environments to Your Pipeline

Let's enhance your existing CI/CD pipeline to include review environments. We'll modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file step by step.

### Step 1: Add the Review Stage

First, add a new stage for review environments in your pipeline:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - review
  - deploy_staging
  - deploy_production
  - production-test
```

### Step 2: Create the Review Environment Job

Add the following job configuration to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
deploy_review:
  stage: review
  script:
    - npm i -g surge
    - surge --domain ${CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG}.surge.sh ./public
  environment:
    name: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    url: https://${CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG}.surge.sh
  only:
    - merge_requests
```

Let's break down what each part does:

- `stage: review`: Places this job in our new review stage
- `environment:name`: Creates a dynamic environment name using the branch name
- `environment:url`: Creates a unique URL for each environment
- `rules`: Ensures this job only runs for merge requests

### Step 3: Understanding the Environment Variables

GitLab provides several predefined variables we're using:

- `$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG`: A "slugified" version of the branch name (lowercase, no special characters)
- `$CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG`: A unique identifier for the environment
- These variables ensure each branch gets its own unique environment and URL

## How It Works

Once configured, here's what happens:

1. You create a new branch for your feature (e.g., `feature/new-header`)
2. You push changes and create a merge request
3. GitLab automatically:
   - Creates a new environment named `review/feature-new-header`
   - Deploys your changes to a unique URL
   - Shows the environment status in the merge request

## Viewing Your Review Environment

To access your review environment:

1. Go to your merge request
2. Look for the "View app" button or the environment URL
3. Click to view your deployed changes

You can share this URL with:
- Other developers for code review
- Product managers for feature verification
- QA team for testing
- Stakeholders for feedback

## Benefits of Review Environments

Review environments provide several advantages:

1. **Isolated Testing**: Each feature has its own environment, preventing conflicts
2. **Early Feedback**: Stakeholders can review changes before they're merged
3. **Better Collaboration**: Easy sharing of work-in-progress features
4. **Quality Assurance**: Thorough testing in an isolated environment
5. **Continuous Integration**: Automatic deployment of every change

## Best Practices

When working with review environments:

1. **Clean Up**: Configure automatic cleanup of environments when branches are deleted
2. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive branch names for clear environment identification
3. **Resource Management**: Monitor resource usage of multiple environments
4. **Security**: Be careful with sensitive data in review environments
5. **Documentation**: Include the review environment URL in merge request descriptions

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Environment Not Creating**:
   - Check if your branch name contains special characters
   - Verify the pipeline is running for merge requests

2. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Check your build artifacts are being passed correctly
   - Verify your deployment credentials

3. **URL Not Accessible**:
   - Ensure your domain configuration is correct
   - Check if the deployment completed successfully

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow using review environments:

1. Create a new feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-header
   ```

2. Make your changes and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new header design"
   git push origin feature/new-header
   ```

3. Create a merge request in GitLab

4. Wait for the pipeline to complete

5. Find your review environment URL in the merge request

6. Share the URL with stakeholders

7. Make additional changes based on feedback

8. Environment automatically updates with new commits
